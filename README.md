### Code, create, contribute

- 🔭 Hi, I’m Mehak Walia, an ex-Amazon software engineer with hands-on experience in full-stack development 
- 🌱 Currently having fun contributing to open-source and collaborating on real-world projects.
- 🔮 Future project ideas:
  -   Build an AI-powered trading bot.
  -   Build an AI bot that automates job applications (resume tailoring, outreach).
  -   Build a Centralized Job Platform. A single platform where applicants can create profiles, apply to multiple jobs, and employers can post opportunities. The system remembers applicant answers across various posts to streamline future applications by reusing and suggesting answers automatically using AI.
