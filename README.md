### Hello, traveler!👋

<!--
**waliamehak/waliamehak** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m Mehak Walia, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m actively seeking software developer roles across Canada.
- 🎯 What absolutely is true about myself is that I am a focussed individual, a very quick learner and love to figure out things on my own. 
- 👯 Over the 6+ years of my education, I have built numerous projects using C++, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, Ract, Django, MongoDB and MySQL. 
- 🚧 I am currently creating a personal portfolio using React.
